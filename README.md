# Math & Miscellaneous Experiments

This repository serves as a personal collection of scripts and code snippets written purely out of curiosity or to solve specific daily-life problems. It is a playground for mathematical explorations, simulations, and handy utilities.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into folders and scripts based on the specific concept or problem being addressed.

Here are some examples of the codebase:

### 1. Pi Hunt (`/Pi`)
Explorations related to the constant **π (Pi)**.
- **`pi_hunt.py`**: A Python script designed to simulate or calculate approximations of Pi using numerical methods.
  - **Algorithms Used**: Compares the convergence and efficiency of the **Leibniz Formula** vs. the **Ramanujan Formula**.
  - **Features**: Visualizes convergence and error rates over varying numbers of parameters/iterations.
- **`pi_hunt.png`**: Visual output generated by the script, plotting the convergence and error of both formulas.

### 2. Euler's Hunt (`/Euler's Number`)
Experiments focused on **Euler's number ($e$)**.
- **`e_hunt.py`**: A script for approximating $e$ using the limit definition: $e = \lim_{n \to \infty} (1 + 1/n)^n$.
  - **Features**: Computes $e$ up to $10^6$ terms and plots the approach to the true value.
- **`e_hunt.png`**: Visualization of the calculation or approximation process.

### 3. Chord Hunt (`chrod_hunt.py`)
A utility script for circle geometry.
- **`chrod_hunt.py`**: A handy tool to calculate the length of a **chord** given the **arc length** and **radius**.
  - **Inputs**: Arc length, Radius.
  - **Outputs**: Chord length, Angle subtended at the center (in Radians).
  - Includes error handling to ensure the arc length does not exceed the circumference.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`: For numerical calculations and vectorization.
  - `matplotlib` (inferred): For generating the plot visualizations (`.png` files).

## 🚀 Usage

Most scripts are standalone and can be executed directly via the terminal.

```bash
# Example: Running the Chord Hunt script
python chrod_hunt.py
```

## 📝 Note
This is a personal archive. Code is maintained as-needed and subject to change as I explore new ideas or refined methods.
